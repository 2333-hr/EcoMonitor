   - **For your own project**: If you are deploying your own version of this project, you will need to generate a new QR code linked to the web interface URL provided by Firebase after your deployment. You can use any QR code generator tool to create a QR code that links to your Firebase-hosted web interface.

By following these steps, you'll be able to build, deploy, and use the EcoMonitor system to monitor air quality in your chosen locations.

## Results and Analysis
- The system was deployed in various locations within East London, including Elizabeth Olympic Park.
- Results indicate consistently low pollutant levels, suggesting good air quality in these areas.
- Detailed data and graphs are available in the project repository for further analysis.

## Limitations
- **Sensor Accuracy**: Budget constraints led to the use of less accurate analog voltage sensors for VOC and CO measurements.
- **Data Transmission**: While Firebase provides robust data storage, there can be slight delays in real-time data visualization.
- **Durability**: The 3D-printed PETG enclosure may degrade under extreme weather conditions over time.

## Future Work
- **Sensor Upgrades**: Implementing more accurate digital sensors for VOCs and CO.
- **Timestamping**: Adding timestamps to each data entry for better temporal analysis.
- **Long-term Deployment**: Testing the systemâ€™s durability in more diverse weather conditions.
