# EcoMonitor: Real-Time Outdoor Air Quality Monitoring Using IoT-Based Sensor Networks in Urban Environments

## Overview
EcoMonitor is a real-time air quality monitoring system developed to assess and visualize air quality data in urban environments. The system utilizes IoT-based sensor networks to monitor various air pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, VOCs, and other environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The collected data is transmitted to Firebase in real-time and made accessible through a user-friendly web interface.

## Results and Analysis
- The system was deployed in various locations within East London, including Elizabeth Olympic Park.
- Results indicate consistently low pollutant levels, suggesting good air quality in these areas.
- Detailed data and graphs are available in the project repository for further analysis.

## Limitations
- **Sensor Accuracy**: Budget constraints led to the use of less accurate analog voltage sensors for VOC and CO measurements.
- **Data Transmission**: While Firebase provides robust data storage, there can be slight delays in real-time data visualization.
- **Durability**: The 3D-printed PETG enclosure may degrade under extreme weather conditions over time.

## Future Work
